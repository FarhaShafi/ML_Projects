Regression subfolder contains jupyter notebook file which implememts the preprocessing techniques and some of the regression techniques.

The objective of this assignment is to evaluate your understanding of regression techniques in
supervised learning by applying them to a real-world dataset.

# Dataset:
Uses the California Housing dataset available in the sklearn library. This dataset contains information about various features of houses in California and their respective median prices.

# Steps Involved:
  ### 1. Loading and Preprocessing
          - Loads the California Housing dataset using the fetch_california_housing function from sklearn.
          - Converts the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easier handling.
          - Checks for the missing values and perform preprocessing and necessary feature scaling (e.g., standardization).
  ### 2. Regression Algorithm Implementation
        Implements the following regression algorithms:
          - Linear Regression
          - Decision Tree Regressor
          - Random Forest Regressor
          - Gradient Boosting Regressor
          - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
  ### 3. Model Evaluation and Comparison
        Evaluates the performance of each algorithm using the following metrics:
          - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
          - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
          - R-squared Score (R2)
        Compares the results of all models and identifies the best-performing algorithm and the worst-performing algorithm.
